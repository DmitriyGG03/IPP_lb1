Task:
Write a program using the API functions that uses the functions of creating and managing flows, processes and tasks.
The program starts 2 threads for execution. Each of them outputs numbers from 1 to 100,000 on the screen in a cycle. 
After each output, the stream stops for 10 seconds. 
In the program, you can dynamically change the priority levels of each thread separately. 
Information about the execution time of each thread and its status is displayed on the screen every 2 seconds.
